problem statement: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reverse-a-linked-list-in-groups-of-given-size/1

Code:

class Solution
{
    public:
    struct node *reverse (struct node *head, int k)
    { 
        
      int count = 0;
      node *previous=NULL;
      node *next;
      node *current =head;
      while(current!=NULL and count<k){
          next = current->next;
          current->next=previous;
          previous = current;
          current = next;
          count++;
      }
      if(next!=NULL){
          head->next = reverse(next,k);
      }
      return previous;
    }
 
 
Expected Time Complexity : O(N)
